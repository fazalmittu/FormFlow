FormFlow (Hackathon Version)
- goal is to help correct a basketball shot
- user uploads a video of them shooting a basketball shot
- we first use openpose to get the human's form
- then we pass in the following as context to GPT:
    - user's form (with openpose overlay)
    - a video of a professional basketball player shooting a similar shot (with openpose overlay)
    - also whatever data openpose gives us
- GPT then corrects the user's form based on the context
- also we'd want to be able to sustain a conversation afterwards and ask follow up questions about the user's form
- ideally we can ask how many shots went in (if the video contains more than one shot)

New Ideas
- we can ask GPT for the key frames that we want to critique

Tools being used:
- OpenPose
- GPT4V
- potentially image embeddings
